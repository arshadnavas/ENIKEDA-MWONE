# [‡¥Æ‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡µÅ Therapist] üéØ


## Basic Details

### Team Members

### Project Description
[AI-powered therapy platform featuring 5 iconic Malayalam comedy characters who provide "professional" mental health advice through hilarious Manglish conversations. Each therapist brings their unique brand of chaos - from Sathyapalan's self-obsessed heroism to Appukuttan's cowardly wisdom - delivering therapy sessions that are guaranteed to make you laugh instead of cry.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Traditional therapy is way too serious, expensive, and actually helpful! People are getting genuinely better mental health support, which is clearly boring. There's a severe shortage of dramatic overacting, confusing philosophical advice, and financial solutions to emotional problems. Worst of all, current therapists don't randomly break into Malayalam movie dialogues or share completely irrelevant personal stories during sessions]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We've assembled the most unqualified yet entertaining therapy team from Malayalam cinema! Our AI-powered therapists include:

- *Sathyapalan* ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Turns every problem into his own heroic journey
- *Chacko Mash* üë®‚Äçüè´ - Provides confusing wisdom with "Ba...ba...ba" philosophy
- *Dashamoolam Damu* üé≠ - Makes your problems seem insignificant compared to his tragic life story
- *Appukuttan* üò∞ - Offers brave advice while hiding under the table
- *Gangadharan* üí∞ - Solves everything with money and questionable business deals]
